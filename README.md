In this Project i am assuming the role of a Data Analyst for Accenture.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
Here is the background information on your task
You’ve been assigned to a new project and the first thing you must do is get up to speed with the business problem that this project is tackling, the requirements that need to be fulfilled as deliverables and the alignment of internal teams with the client.

You will be working within a large team at Accenture and there will be several people on your team doing different roles to make this project a success.

As a data analyst, it is imperative that you have a solid understanding of the project as quickly as possible. A data analyst sits between the business and the data, so it’s important that you have a deep understanding from both sides to provide insights. You need to use the client brief to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on.
To make sure that you have understood the project, you will be tested on an outline of the business problem, the requirements and the delegation of tasks.


# Here is the background information on your task:
You have been given a set of data sets, all containing different columns and values, as well as a data model. A data model shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

It is your job to use these data sets as well as the data model, to create your own data set that you can use to fulfill the requirements of this task. 

This task is essential because it is one of the specific requirements that the client has asked for, so we are relying on the data analyst to work with the data and create accurate, reliable insights that can be backed up during the final presentation.

As a data analyst, it is important that you work with both the business and the data. Now that you have gained the business understanding, it’s time to put your analysis skills to the test. 

The next step will be bringing the data set to life. A large component of being a data analyst, includes the ability to find relevant insights and ensure that they are clearly communicated to the business and client. These insights should be synthesized and placed in a presentation for the client that is engaging and easily understood. 

There is an art to selecting the correct visualizations for your presentation and it’s important that corresponding communications tell a powerful story. For this reason, the powerful tools of data visualization & storytelling will be key to this task. 

The analysis that you provide will play a key part in the fulfillment of this requirement, so you will play an important role in this project!
