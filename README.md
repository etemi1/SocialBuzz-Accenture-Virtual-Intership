# In this Project i am assuming the role of a Data Analyst for Accenture.

# INSTRUCTION
Here is the background information on your task
You’ve been assigned to a new project and the first thing you must do is get up to speed with the business problem that this project is tackling, the requirements that need to be fulfilled as deliverables and the alignment of internal teams with the client.

You will be working within a large team at Accenture and there will be several people on your team doing different roles to make this project a success.

As a data analyst, it is imperative that you have a solid understanding of the project as quickly as possible. A data analyst sits between the business and the data, so it’s important that you have a deep understanding from both sides to provide insights. You need to use the client brief to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on.
To make sure that you have understood the project, you will be tested on an outline of the business problem, the requirements and the delegation of tasks.
